-- Lab:	Querying Multiple Tables

-- FROM clause determines source table to be used in SELECT statment
-- FROM caluse can contain table and operators
-- Result set of FROM clause is virtuale table
-- FROM clause can establish table aliases for use by subsequent phases of query

-- When learning about writing multitable queries in T-SQL, it is important to understand the concept of Cartesian products. 
-- In mathematics, this is the product of two sets. 
-- The product of a set of two items and a set of six is a set of 12 itemsâ€”or 6 x 2. 
-- In databases, a Cartesian product is the result of joining every row of one input table to all rows of another input table.

-- Join types, description
-- Cross, Combines all rows in both tables, creates cartesian product
-- Inner, Starts with cartesian product, applies filter to match rows between tables based on predicate
-- Outer , Startes with cartesion product, all rows from designated table preserved, matching rows from other table retrieved. Additional NULLS inserted as placeholders
